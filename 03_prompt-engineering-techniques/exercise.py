            <sample_input>
              This study examines the relationship between remote work adoption and urban housing demand using longitudinal survey data from 2,847 households across metropolitan areas. Our regression analysis reveals a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.42, p < 0.001) between full-time remote work eligibility and residential proximity to central business districts, with workers relocating an average of 12.3 miles farther from city centers. These findings have profound implications for urban planning policy, suggesting that zoning regulations and transit infrastructure investments must be reconsidered as traditional commuting patterns dissolve. Additionally, we document secondary effects on commercial real estate valuations and local tax revenues, indicating that policymakers face a complex trade-off between workforce flexibility and municipal fiscal sustainability.

              We synthesized a series of novel copper(II) complexes with N,N'-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine ligands through a condensation reaction at 60°C for 4 hours. The resulting compounds were characterized using X-ray crystallography, revealing octahedral coordination geometry around the metal center. UV-vis spectroscopy showed λmax values between 420-450 nm, consistent with d-d transitions. We evaluated the catalytic activity of these complexes in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using H₂O₂ as the oxidant under aerobic conditions. The turnover frequency (TOF) reached 240 h⁻¹ for the most active catalyst, with excellent substrate selectivity and minimal over-oxidation products.

            Although the output format is correct, it has a notable deficiency in the secondary criteria by including 'Condensation reaction,' which is explicitly a procedural/methodological element (described as 'condensation reaction at 60°C for 4 hours')
            The solution does well on identifying concrete technical topics and distinguishing chemical compounds, but the inclusion of a procedural step prevents a higher score. The omission of some minor topics like 'd-d transitions' is less critical than the inclusion of procedural content.

              This study examines the relationship between remote work adoption and urban housing demand using longitudinal survey data from 2,847 households across metropolitan areas. Our regression analysis reveals a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.42, p < 0.001) between full-time remote work eligibility and residential proximity to central business districts, with workers relocating an average of 12.3 miles farther from city centers. These findings have profound implications for urban planning policy, suggesting that zoning regulations and transit infrastructure investments must be reconsidered as traditional commuting patterns dissolve. Additionally, we document secondary effects on commercial real estate valuations and local tax revenues, indicating that policymakers face a complex trade-off between workforce flexibility and municipal fiscal sustainability.

The resulting compounds were characterized using X-ray crystallography, revealing octahedral coordination geometry around the metal center. UV-vis spectroscopy showed λmax values between 420-450 nm, consistent with d-d transitions. We evaluated the catalytic activity of these complexes in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using H₂O₂ as the oxidant under aerobic conditions. The turnover frequency (TOF) reached 240 h⁻¹ for the most active catalyst, with excellent substrate selectivity and minimal over-oxidation products.

              This study examines the relationship between remote work adoption and urban housing demand using longitudinal survey data from 2,847 households across metropolitan areas. Our regression analysis reveals a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.42, p < 0.001) between full-time remote work eligibility and residential proximity to central business districts, with workers relocating an average of 12.3 miles farther from city centers. These findings have profound implications for urban planning policy, suggesting that zoning regulations and transit infrastructure investments must be reconsidered as traditional commuting patterns dissolve. Additionally, we document secondary effects on commercial real estate valuations and local tax revenues, indicating that policymakers face a complex trade-off between workforce flexibility and municipal fiscal sustainability.

            <sample_input>
              We synthesized a series of novel copper(II) complexes with N,N'-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine ligands through a condensation reaction at 60°C for 4 hours. The resulting compounds were characterized using X-ray crystallography, revealing octahedral coordination geometry around the metal center. UV-vis spectroscopy showed λmax values between 420-450 nm, consistent with d-d transitions. We evaluated the catalytic activity of these complexes in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using H₂O₂ as the oxidant under aerobic conditions. The turnover frequency (TOF) reached 240 h⁻¹ for the most active catalyst, with excellent substrate selectivity and minimal over-oxidation products.

            Although the output format is correct, it has a notable deficiency in the secondary criteria by including 'Condensation reaction,' which is explicitly a procedural/methodological element (described as 'condensation reaction at 60°C for 4 hours')
            The solution does well on identifying concrete technical topics and distinguishing chemical compounds, but the inclusion of a procedural step prevents a higher score. The omission of some minor topics like 'd-d transitions' is less critical than the inclusion of procedural content.

            <sample_input>
      The concept of human agency has long occupied a central position in philosophical discourse, yet its relationship to moral responsibility remains contested. Enlightenment thinkers posited that rational autonomy constituted the foundation of ethical accountability, a view that shaped legal frameworks throughout the nineteenth century. However, historical analysis reveals how social structures and power dynamics constrained individual choice in ways philosophers had not adequately theorized. Contemporary debates between compatibilists and libertarians reflect this tension: while some argue that moral responsibility requires freedom from deterministic causation, others contend that responsibility can coexist with a deterministic universe if agents act according to their own desires and reasoning. This philosophical disagreement carries profound implications for how we understand criminal justice, personal accountability, and the nature of human freedom itself.

            The solution meets all mandatory requirements: it is a valid JSON array of strings, contains only topics without commentary, and includes nothing else. It successfully identifies core philosophical concepts as specified in the secondary criteria (agency, moral responsibility, autonomy, determinism, compatibilism, libertarianism). The extraction is comprehensive and recognizes overlapping themes across philosophy, ethics, and history. However, there is minor redundancy in how determinism-related concepts are represented, and the inclusion of application domains (criminal justice) alongside theoretical concepts slightly blurs the distinction between main topics and contextual references. These are minor issues that don't violate requirements but represent room for refinement in topic selection precision.

            The solution meets all mandatory requirements: it is a valid JSON array of strings with only topic names and no extra commentary. However, it has notable deficiencies against the secondary criteria. The inclusion of 'Longitudinal survey data' and 'Regression analysis' directly violates the instruction to extract topics 'without including methodology details.' The criteria explicitly distinguish between primary research topics and secondary analytical topics, and methodology should be excluded. The solution includes 15 items when a more refined extraction excluding methodology would be stronger. Despite these issues, the core task is accomplished with good coverage of the actual research topics.
